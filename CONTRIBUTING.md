# Contributing to Calzone

Calzone is an [open-source][OPEN_SOURCE] project, which means that you, as a
user, are welcome to contribute by reporting any [issues][ISSUES] or suggesting
[new features][ISSUES].

The Calzone [source code](src) is written in [Rust][RUST] with a pinch of C++
(for interfacing to Geant4, using the [cxx][CXX] crate). The Python user
interface is generated using the [PyO3][PYO3] crate. If you have knowledge of
[Rust][RUST] (and C++, Python, and [Geant4][GEANT4]), or wish to start learning
[Rust][RUST], submitting fixes or new features as [pull requests][PR] would be
even more welcomed.
